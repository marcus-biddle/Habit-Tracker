# Habit Tracker 📅

Designed to help a user track the progression of their habits and goals to help better understand their consistency.

## Background 💡
I have multiple different media for tracking random tasks, such as how much water I drink in a day (MyFitnessPal app), how many miles I run in a year (Strava app), how many pushups and pullups I do each day (Google sheets). This is designed to make my life easier and have everything in one place.

## What I learned 🧠
- How to design and implement a relational database schema in Supabase
- Implementing server-side functions or triggers to update automatically
- Working with Supabase SQL functions, including some edge cases like time zone handling and date calculations
- Managing state and asynchronous data fetching
