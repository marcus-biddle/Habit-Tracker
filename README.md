# Habit Tracker 📅

Designed to help a user track the progression of their habits and goals to help better understand their consistency.

## Background 💡
I had too many different apps that tracked different habits (Strava, MyFitnessPal, Google Sheets). I wanted a singular app that can keep track of everything and provide clarity into my habit patterns.

## What I learned 🧠
- How to design and implement a relational database schema in Supabase
- Implementing server-side functions or triggers to update automatically
- Working with Supabase SQL functions, including some edge cases like time zone handling and date calculations
- Managing state and asynchronous data fetching

## How it looks 📷
